# Gutenprint Printer Application

## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains a Printer Application for printing with the
Gutenprint printer driver. This allows high-quality printing on a wide
range of inkjet, lasre, and dye-sublimation printers, especially
inkjets from Epson and Canon, PCL laser printers (both monochrome and
color), and dye-sublimation photo printers. This driver is especially
recommended for photos and fine-art printing. It is also an
alternative to the [Ghostscript Printer
Application](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ghostscript-printer-app)
for PCL 4/5c/e laser printers.

It uses [PAPPL](https://www.msweet.org/pappl) to support IPP printing
from multiple operating systems. In addition, it uses the resources of
[cups-filters 2.x](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters)
(filter functions in libcupsfilters, libppd) and
[pappl-retrofit](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/pappl-retrofit)
(encapsulating classic CUPS drivers in Printer Applications). The code
of pappl-retrofit is derived from the
[hp-printer-app](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/hp-printer-app).

The printer driver itself and the software to communicate with the
printer hardware is taken from the [Gutenprint
project](http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/), also the Information
about supported printer models and their capabilities.

Your contributions are welcome. Please post [issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/gutenprint-printer-app).

**Note: Gutenprint is an actively maintained project, therefore it
would also be the correct way if Gutenprint gets turned into a Printer
Application by its maintainers, or at least this be offered as an
alternative to the classic CUPS driver. Especially they should create
a native Printer Application, meaning that it does not use PPDs, CUPS
filters, and CUPS backends internally. As soon as the Gutenprint
project provides a native Printer Application, this Printer
Application retro-fitting the CUPS driver will get discontinued.**

Please check whether your printer is a driverless IPP printer
(AirPrint, Mopria, IPP Everywhere, Wi-Fi Direct Print, prints from
phones) as in this case you do not need any Printer Application at
all. Most modern printers, even the cheapest models, are driverless
IPP printers. Even USB-only printers can be driverless IPP, and you
can generally use driverless IPP via USB, try
[ipp-usb](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ipp-usb) for these cases
first.


### Properties

- A Printer Application providing the Gutenprint CUPS Raster printer
  driver and all printer's PPDs of Gutenprint. This allows easy
  printing in high quality, including photos on photo paper. The
  specialized CUPSbackend for dye sublimation printers with
  proprietary USB communication protocols is also included.

- The Printer Application checks the supported number of
  vendor-specific options/attributes of the installed PAPPL library,
  `PAPPL_MAX_VENDOR` and uses the expert PPDs only if 256 or more
  vendor-specific options are supported, otherwise the simplified PPDs
  are used. By default, the number is 32 and in the Rock we modify it
  to be 256, meaning that the Gutenprint Printer Application Rock uses expert PPDs, while a quick build with `make`,
  using an installed standard PAPPL library uses the simplified PPD
  files.

- Available printer devices are discovered (and used) with CUPS'
  backends and with Gutenprint's dye-sublimation printer backend in
  addition and not with PAPPL's own backends. This way dye-sublimation
  printers are discovered with the correct backend for their totally
  proprietary communication protocol. Also quirk workarounds for USB
  printers with compatibility problems are used (and are editable) and
  Gutenprint output can get send to the printer via IPP, IPPS
  (encrypted!), and LPD in addition to socket (usually port 9100). The
  SNMP backend can get configured (community, address scope).

- If you have an unusual system configuration or a personal firewall
  your printer will perhaps not get discovered. In this situation the
  fully manual "Network Printer" entry in combination with the
  hostname/IP field can be helpful.

- PWG Raster, Apple Raster or image input data does not get converted
  to PostScript or PDF, it is only converted/scaled to the required
  color space and resolution and then fed into the Gutenprint CUPS
  Raster driver.

- PDF and PostScript input data is rendered into raster data using
  Ghostscript.

- The information about which printer models are supported and which
  are their capabilities is based on the PPD files which get
  auto-generated by Gutenprint when using it with CUPS. The PPD
  generator is included in the Rock.

- Standard job IPP attributes are mapped to the driver's option
  settings best fitting to them so that users can print from any type
  of client (like for example a phone or IoT device) which only
  supports standard IPP attributes and cannot retrive the PPD
  options. Trays, media sizes, media types, and duplex can get mapped
  easily, but when it comes to color and quality it gets more complex,
  as relevant options differ a lot in the PPD files. Here we use an
  algorithm which automatically (who wants hand-edit ~3000 PPD files
  for the assignments) finds the right set of option settings for each
  combination of `print-color-mode` (`color`/`monochrome`),
  `print-quality` (`draft`/`normal`/`high`), and
  `print-content-optimize`
  (`auto`/`photo`/`graphics`/`text`/`text-and-graphics`) in the PPD of
  the current printer. So you have easy access to the full quality or
  speed of your printer without needing to deal with printer-specific
  option settings (the original options are still accessible via web
  admin interface).

## Install from Docker Hub
### Prerequisites

1. **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Pull the gutenprint-printer-app docker image:

The first step is to pull the gutenprint-printer-app Docker image from Docker Hub.
```sh
sudo docker pull openprinting/gutenprint-printer-app
```

#### 2. Start the gutenprint-printer-app Container

##### Run the following Docker command to run the gutenprint-printer-app image:
```sh
sudo docker run --rm -d --name gutenprint-printer-app -p <port>:8000 \
    openprinting/gutenprint-printer-app:latest
```

## Setting Up and Running gutenprint-printer-app locally

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Rockcraft**: Rockcraft should be installed. You can install Rockcraft using the following command:
```sh
sudo snap install rockcraft --classic
```

3. **Skopeo**: Skopeo should be installed to compile `.rock` files into Docker images. <br>
**Note**: It comes bundled with Rockcraft.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Build gutenprint-printer-app rock:

The first step is to build the Rock from the `rockcraft.yaml`. This image will contain all the configurations and dependencies required to run gutenprint-printer-app.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `rockcraft.yaml`, then run the following command:

```sh
rockcraft pack -v
```

#### 2. Compile to Docker Image:

Once the rock is built, you need to compile docker image from it.

```sh
sudo rockcraft.skopeo --insecure-policy copy oci-archive:<rock_image> docker-daemon:gutenprint-printer-app:latest
```

#### Run the gutenprint-printer-app Docker Container:

```sh
sudo docker run --rm -d --name gutenprint-printer-app -p <port>:8000 \
    gutenprint-printer-app:latest
```

### Setting up

Enter the web interface

```sh
http://localhost:<port>/
```

Use the web interface to add a printer. Supply a name, select the
discovered printer, then select make and model. Also set the installed
accessories, loaded media and the option defaults. Accessory
configuration and option defaults can also offen get polled from the
printer.
